CLAIM
// CLAIM= S says all the rest are her tricks,no matter how she plays
// You can ask the user these questions the 1st time North must play
// Q1 "How many winners/losers do you have?"
// Q2 "What threats do you see?"
// Q3 "What opportunities do you see?"
// Q4 "Is there a danger suit?"
// Q5 "Is there a danger hand?"
// Q6 "What do you know from the bidding?"
// Q7 "What is your plan?"
// So input will have answers to Q1 to Q6 given next:

you could lose control of trumps.
you can ruff S in dummy; you can finesse in H and S; you can establish in S.
there is no danger suit.
there is no danger hand.
you do not know anything from the bidding.
// the answer to "what is your plan" is part of the lesson text.
// Only show this after the game, or whenever user asks for it
Plan to finesse in S twice, and then ruff a 3rd S in dummy, and hopefully you will then also have established your last two S as winners - this will mean you have no losers in S & as you also have no losers in C you hope to limit losers in H and D to just 3 losers.
On the first trick, finesse the JD, hoping W had the QD;
On the 2nd trick, play KH or QH - can't afford to play TH (in case W wins with JH and then plays AH and then a 3rd H, making it impossible for you to later ruff a S in dummy);
On the 3rd trick, do not take the C finesse as it will not help you, win with the AC;
Now put your S plan into action, and after ruffing the 3rd round of S in dummy, finesse upto the TH;
When that finesse loses and W plays the QD, you must play the KD because if it doesn't win now it never will;
Once the KD wins the rest of the tricks are yours!
// 4 strategies: you can pick up the keywords in the lesson:
// finess ruff establish discard
// there was no discard opportunity in this lesson.
// Lesson text is where each lesson ends, so I'll follow it with:
